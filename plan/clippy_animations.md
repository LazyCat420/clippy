Fix clippy animations for the eyes so it can see where the box is. 
Make clippy animations synced with relavant information of whats happening maybe we use some kind of tool calling so the ai can pick what animation it wants to use so it's more dynamic and not just the most predictive animation over and over. 
Make it so clippy can use the idle animations to look like it's paying attention to the user. 
Have clippy be able to save/edit/delete data so we can use those animations.
